    <h3>Muny Picker</h3>
        <p class="picker">I started working as a Muny Picker during the summer of 2006. 
            The Muny is the largest outdoor theater musical theatre in the country, and a picker is the person who picks up the trash in the theatre.
            Six days a week in the summer I would wake up at 8 in the morning and leave for work.
            Picking up trash seems like an easy, gross job, but to be an efficent picker took some planning.
            Depending on the show you have to know how many trash bags to get, and you had to employ a complex system where you place one bag at both ends of a row and one bag in the middle of a row.
            This system was called &quot;The Quicker Picker Upper&quot;
            The trash bags we used were the large paper bags often used to dispose of yard waste so they could stand up on their own.
            Having three bags placed throughout the row allows a picker to get all of the trash between the bags without having to walk back to the beginning of the row.
            As pass a trash bag you place that bag in the next row down and keep moving through the section.

    <h3>Lacrosse Coach</h3>
        <p class="lacrosse">When I was going to school in California, I coached lacrosse for a U13 team.
            I played lacrosse in grade school and high school. My senior year of high school, we won state for the first time in our school's history.
            I decided not to play in college to focus on my school work, but my senior year I decided to coach for a youth team.
            Prior to taking this job, I had no experience coaching, teaching, or dealing with crazy protective parents.
            The team was called the Vipers and I coached kids under 13 years old. 
            Coaching 11 to 13 year olds was difficult in the beginning. They quickly picked up on the fact that I had no experience coaching or teaching kids.
            They would constantly try to knock my stick out of my hands, make fun of my hair, and try to wrestle me.
            I quickly learned that running laps and doing pushups at the beginning of practice made them too tired to try to mess with me, and I was able to teach them the fundamentals of lacrosse.
            Dealing with parents was a little more challenging than coaching kids. 
            Parents would constantly complain about their kids playing time.
            I was the only coach for the U13 team and during a game my main focus was on the game. 
            The way I managed the bench was to have the kids line up and when there was a line change I would take the first three kdis in line.
            If kids weren't paying attention or not getting in line then they would not play.
            One parent brought a stop watch to a game to clock her kids time compared to another kid on the team, and she added up the times and showed me her work at the end of a game.
            I told her my system for playing kids and that they have to take responsibility for their own playing time. 
            She never complained to me again.

    <h3>EMT</h3>
        <p class="emt">After college, I moved back home and took a class to become an EMT.
            I got a job at Abbott Ambulance, a private ambulance company in St. Louis.
            When I first started, it was intimitading having strangers trust you with their lives.
            It was scary talking to doctors and nurses in the ER trying to tell them what happened while they are treating a patient.
            I quickly developed better personal skills talking to patients and the hospital staff. 
            Having a the same partner everyday taught me to work efficently as a team.
            My partner and I knew our roles and what we were doing at all times which is important when going into dangerous situations and quick decisions have to be made.
            This job has opened my eyes to other parts of the city that I have never been. 
            I got to see people from all walks of life at their worst moments which was a humbling experience.
